## Hi, Iâ€™m Boualleiguie Adam Isslem ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ Senior DevOps | DevSecOps | SysOps Engineer | IT Enthusiast

Iâ€™m a Senior Engineer with extensive hands-on experience in automating, managing, and securing complex infrastructures. My expertise spans across multiple domains, from **CI/CD pipelines** and **cloud-native architectures** to **hypervisor management** and **networking**. I love the entire spectrum of ITâ€”whether it's fine-tuning system performance, designing robust CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform environments, or managing production-ready Kubernetes clusters.

### ðŸŒŸ What I Master:
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Advanced pipeline setups for multi-platform monorepos (Java, Flutter, iOS) and custom configurations for complex workflows. Expertise in **self-hosted GitLab** administration, from setting up runners to managing bare-metal installations.
  
- **Kubernetes & GitOps**: Advanced knowledge in Kubernetes for deployment, microservices architecture, and full cluster management. Skilled in setting up GitOps with **ArgoCD**, **FluxCD**, and **Fleet** for seamless app deployments.
  
- **Cloud & Hypervisor Solutions**: Proficient in **Rancher**, **Longhorn**, and **Harvester** for SUSE-based solutions. Deep expertise with **Proxmox** for hypervisor management.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Strong capabilities in **Terraform** for automating infrastructure provisioning and **Ansible** (including Kubespray) for setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters.

- **Security & SSDLC**: Skilled in integrating **SonarQube** for both **SAST** and **DAST**, creating secure pipelines and establishing secure software development lifecycles (SSDLC).

- **Networking & System Administration**: Comprehensive knowledge of networking, system security, and infrastructure management, making me versatile across DevOps and SysOps roles.

### ðŸ”§ Key Tools & Technologies:
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube
- **Containers & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, Longhorn
- **IaC**: Terraform, Ansible, Kubespray
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD, FluxCD, Fleet
- **Hypervisors**: Proxmox
- **Networking**: Advanced knowledge of networking concepts, firewall configuration, and system-level performance optimization.

### ðŸ“š My Approach:
I'm a fast learner with a natural ability to grasp and master new technologies quickly. Whether it's a fresh DevOps tool, a cutting-edge cloud solution, or a complex infrastructure problem, I dive deep, implement best practices, and optimize processes to ensure maximum efficiency.
