## Hi, Iâ€™m Boualleiguie Adam Isslem ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ Senior DevOps | DevSecOps | SysOps Engineer | IT Enthusiast

Iâ€™m a Senior Engineer with extensive hands-on experience in automating, managing, and securing complex infrastructures. My expertise spans multiple domains, from **CI/CD pipelines** and **cloud-native architectures** to **hypervisor management** and **networking**. I love the entire spectrum of ITâ€”whether it's fine-tuning system performance, designing robust CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform environments, or managing production-ready Kubernetes clusters.

### ðŸŒŸ What I Master:
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Advanced pipeline setups for multi-platform monorepos (Java, Flutter, iOS, Angular, and NX-managed projects) and custom configurations for complex workflows. Expertise in **self-hosted GitLab** administration, including setting up runners, fine-tuning server performance, managing bare-metal installations, and disaster recovery.

- **Kubernetes & GitOps**: Advanced knowledge in Kubernetes for deployment, microservices architecture, and full cluster management. Proficient in implementing GitOps methodologies with **ArgoCD**, **FluxCD**, and **Fleet** for seamless application deployments.

- **Cloud & Hypervisor Solutions**: Proficient in managing Kubernetes clusters with **Rancher** and implementing persistent storage solutions with **Longhorn**. Experienced in **Harvester** for HCI environments and **Proxmox** for hypervisor management.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Strong capabilities in **Terraform** for automating the creation of guest VMs in Proxmox via cloud-init templates and using **Ansible** for various automation tasks, including setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters.

- **Cybersecurity & SSDLC**: Experienced in establishing secure software development lifecycles (SSDLC) by integrating tools like **SonarQube**, **Trivy**, **Harbor**, and **NeuVector** for SAST and DAST scans within automated pipelines. I also practice penetration testing to enhance the security of my solutions.

- **Networking & System Administration**: Comprehensive knowledge of networking, system security, and infrastructure management, making me versatile across DevOps and SysOps roles.

### ðŸ”§ Key Tools & Technologies:
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, Jenkins
- **Containers & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **CaC**: Ansible
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD, FluxCD, Fleet
- **Hypervisors**: Proxmox, vSphere, Harvester (HCI)
- **Networking**: Advanced knowledge of networking concepts, firewall configuration, and system-level performance optimization.
- **Linux Administration**

### ðŸ“š My Approach:
I'm a fast learner with a natural ability to grasp and master new technologies quickly. Whether it's a new DevOps tool, a cutting-edge cloud solution, or a complex infrastructure problem, I dive deep, implement best practices, and optimize processes to ensure maximum efficiency.
